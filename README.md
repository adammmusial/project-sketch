## About the Project

This project replicates a fun and interactive drawing application inspired by the classic Etch-a-Sketch toy. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project allows users to create a grid of squares and draw on them by hovering over each cell. You can customize the grid size, clear the current grid, and start fresh with a new one. It's a great way to experiment with DOM manipulation and event handling.
