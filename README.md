## About the Project

I built this fun and interactive drawing app inspired by the classic Etch-a-Sketch toy. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I created a grid of squares that users can draw on just by hovering over each cell. You can adjust the grid size, clear it, and start fresh whenever you want. This project helped me learn a lot about DOM manipulation and handling user interactions.
